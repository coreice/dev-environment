In this repository I keep the settings I use for my terminal etc. Mostly as a personal reference.

Currently using:

- zsh
- zinit for zsh
- Alacritty
- iterm theme for Alacritty
- Powerlevel10k
- tmux
- nvim

## Alacritty

Icon fix: https://github.com/hmarr/dotfiles/blob/099af97f7165579bcc41579891c05dcbba567f16/bin/update-alacritty-icon.sh

## Updates

- started using Alacritty since end of May 2024
- Sticked with p10k because it looked less bloated then starship
